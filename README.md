# To Do List

## About

This project has functioned as my playground for React. I wanted to practice putting together a basic app and soon realised that to do so with any real meaning, I needed an API. So I built a basic Laravel API (see it [here](https://github.com/tombassrosenfeld/to-do-api)) for my to do list app and then linked them up. 

I also started writing this app using connected and class based components before deciding to refactor and use hooks. There's still a few bits of legacy code that I should really tidy up but haven't gotten around to yet. 

There are lots of small ui touches to add. Using the escape key to exit the add card input and updating the field editor component to trigger a patch request on submit. 

The list of major updates is endless and I will keep tackling those as and when I have time. Drag and drop or some other method of order change is up there. The ability to add new lists. 


Feel free to have a dig about and let me know how I can improve my code.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
